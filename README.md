# PrimalDual-Python
Python implementation of primal-dual algorithms for image processing
 
 This toolbox provides some basic operators (gradient, divergence) as well as 
 some classic proximal operators. These are then used to solve the following 
 image processing algorithms:
 - Rudin-Osher-Fatemi - TV-L^2 model
 - TV-L^1 model
 - TV-L^2 for inpainting
 - TV-L^2 with multi-observations

 Check the Jupyter Notebook for an example of using these functions
 
 See the documentation in the Documentation folder for more details!
